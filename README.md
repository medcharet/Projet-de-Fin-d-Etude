# Yield Curve Modeling and Value at Risk Estimation

## Overview

This repository contains the source code, data, and documentation for our final year project focused on the modeling of the yield curve and the estimation of Value at Risk (VaR). This project was conducted as part of our engineering studies in Actuarial Science and Finance at the Institut National de Statistique et d’Économie Appliquée (INSEA), in collaboration with Banque Populaire.

## Introduction

In the context of financial risk management, it is crucial to allocate capital to guard against potential losses resulting from market price fluctuations, as recommended by the Basel Committee. This project aims to measure market risk using internal models, commonly referred to as Value at Risk (VaR).

## Project Structure

### 1. Yield Curve

- **Interest Rate Concepts**: Understanding various types of interest rates.
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Definition and implications of interest rate risk.
- **Yield Curve Definition and Forms**: Exploration of different yield curve shapes.
- **Zero-Coupon Curve Construction**: Utilizing the bootstrap method.
- **Stochastic Modeling of the Yield Curve**: Implementation of models like Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Vasicek.

### 2. Risk Measurement

- **Risk Definition**: Identifying and quantifying different types of risks.
- **Market Risk**: Specific focus on market risk.
- **Risk Measures**: Explanation of various risk measures.
  
### 3. Value at Risk (VaR) Estimation

- **VaR Principles and Definitions**: Introduction to Value at Risk.
- **VaR Estimation Methods**: Historical approach, Monte Carlo simulation, and parametric methods.
- **Statistical Tests**: Including Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling, and Jarque-Bera tests.

### 4. Backtesting

- **Backtesting Principles**: Validation tests such as Kupiec's test.
- **Maximum Likelihood Testing**: Application of statistical methods to backtest VaR.

### 5. Practical Results

- **Automation with VBA**: Automating interest rate data retrieval and analysis using VBA.
- **Model Comparison**: Comparing different VaR estimation methods.
- **Portfolio VaR Calculation**: Practical application on a foreign exchange futures portfolio.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/medcharet/Projet-de-Fin-d-Etude.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Projet-de-Fin-d-Etude
    ```

3. **Dependencies**:
    - List any dependencies and how to install them.

4. **Running the Analysis**:
    - Provide instructions on how to execute the scripts, including any necessary commands or configurations.

## Results

- **Graphs and Charts**: Visual representations of the yield curves and VaR results.
- **Backtesting Outcomes**: Summaries of the backtesting analysis and validation results.
